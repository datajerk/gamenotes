# Gamenotes

My notes about games that I could not find elsewhere, either because I am too lazy or my Google foo (goo?) is weak.

Each game has a directory with its own `README.md` and possibly other supporting files.

I am not really a _gamer_ per sÄ“.  I think I have spent more time reading and researching about games than actually playing them.  Do not expect quality content here.
